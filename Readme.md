# GraalVM Polyglot example program

### Just playing around with runtimes in JIT compiler, 
### super inaccurate obviously

### Runtime for the ruby eval goes from ~3400 ms to 340 ms. 
### For Python around  ~6300 to ~600 ms (high variance) in three runs



### Ran with:
```js --polyglot --jvm polyglot.js```
